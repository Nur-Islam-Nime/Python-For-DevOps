    # Rule 1: Use snake_case for variable names
first_name = "Nur Islam"
last_name = "Nime"

    # CamelCase is not preferred in python

    #userName = "Nime"   


    # Rule 2: Must start with Letter or underscore
name = "Ansible"    # Good practice 
_language = "Bash"  # Good practice

    #   1name = "Wrong"     # Wrong Coz start with number

    # Rule 3: No spaces or special characters

    # &data = 100   # Wrong Coz start with special characters

    # Rule 4: Avoid reserved keywords
    # class = 'abc'     # Wrong Coz Class keyword reserved in python

    #f-string (modern and recommended)
print(f'My name is {last_name}')

print("Hello", first_name )
